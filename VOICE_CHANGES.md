2. Browser asks for microphone permission (if first time)
3. User speaks into microphone
4. Speech is converted to text and appears in textarea
5. User can edit the text if needed
6. User manually clicks Send button to send message
7. Mic button can be clicked again to stop/start listening

### 🚀 **Testing**

To test the voice functionality:

1. Open the frontend application
2. Click the 🎤 microphone button
3. Allow microphone permissions if prompted
4. Speak your message
5. See the text appear in the input field

The microphone will only activate when you explicitly click the mic button, and messages will only send when you click the send button.
